## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application using Docker. This setup ensures that all necessary services are built and started correctly, with session management handled seamlessly via a Redis database.

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Ensure that Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose**: Typically included with Docker Desktop installations. Verify by running `docker-compose --version`. 

### Steps to Initialize the Application

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samugit83/SurfAi
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd SurfAi
```

3. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

4. Run the Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Check the backend logs:
```bash
docker logs -f surf_ai
```
  
6. Access the AI Agent chat interface:
```bash 
http://localhost:5000
``` 

7. Access the automated navigation in the browser:
```bash
http://localhost:6901/vnc.html
```

- if you want to rebuild and restart the application:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
docker logs -f surf_ai  
```

7. Environment Variables:
Create a file named .env in the root folder and insert all the following variables to ensure the application functions correctly:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=open_ai_api_key 
FLASK_PORT=5000
SURF_AI_JSON_TASK_MODEL=gpt-4o 
```

8. Some prompt example:
- Go to Amazon and search for an iPhone 13 smartphone. Navigate to the page of the first result and tell me the vendor name in the buy box, the selling price, and if it offers Prime.
- Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed, log in with email: 'mymail' and password: 'mypassword'. Comment on the first 2 posts with intelligent and contextually relevant comments based on the text and image of the post, with a minimum of 40 words.
- Visit 4 different electronics e-commerce websites to obtain the average price of the top 3 search results for the query: iPhone 13 Pro. The websites are: https://www.bestbuy.com/, https://www.croma.com/, https://www.mediaworld.it/, https://www.boulanger.com/. Then, provide me with a comparison report of the prices found. If you find a currency other than the euro, search on Google for the latest exchange rate and convert it.
